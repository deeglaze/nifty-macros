#Nifty Macros
Collections of Racket macros I've found useful and general enough to share.

Install with:

```bash
raco pkg install github://github.com/deeglaze/nifty-macros/master
```
Abstracts for individual collections:

`for-acc`:
Allows user-defined accumulation styles for use in `for[*]/fold`. Details in its README.
